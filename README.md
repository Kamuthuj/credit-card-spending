This projects aims to analyze credit card spending in India. I did this project to get insights on how different card types are used and for what purposes. I performed feature extraction to get new columns such as Year,Month and the city where the cards are used.This would be essential for my analysis. I utilized python's plotly to create visualizations which showed how credit cards are used based on different purposes and also showed how different genders use different cards for different purposes.
